# Jekyll

As the Jekyll learning notes get longer and longer, I put it here independently for clarification. \
Supplementary materials related to Terminal commands and MacOS system involved in the exploration of Jekyll might also be included, as 
this is a web developing tool from letter-by-letter coding without an existing graphic interface (even it has Jekyll Admin you have to install
it from commands in Gemfile!) so it provides an opportunity to figure out these fundamental coding techniques.
